              contributing immediately. He instantly started writing
              Groovy/Spock like he had been doing it for years, started knocking
              out stories almost as fast as I could write them, and provided
              good feedback on the design, architecture, and implementation.
              With only two of us and a very short deadline, I could not have
              done this without him."

              with Dylan when particularly difficult or complicated issues would

              Relatively new to Dialexa, but you would have no idea with how
              quickly he fit into the team, adapted to new processes, and picked
              up new technologies. He exemplifies all of Dialexa's best traits
              and has become a fundamental member of the team. He has eased some
              of my anxieties on this project with his knowledge on [certain
              difficult technologies] and I appreciate his willingness to
              research options and his patience in sharing some of the knowledge
              with me. We're lucky to have Dylan on this team!"
